<p>Latest update on the ongoing website design. The <a href = "Panda.html">VIZ</a> page has been updated with Google map with polylines connecting manager, repeater, and sensor node. Polyline <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp">color code</a> are setup according to Michigan’s Parking lot ranking. Except for light green (#00FF00) representing 90+ quality performance, Blue (#0000CC), Yellow (#FFFF00'), Orange (#FF3300), and then Red (#FF0000) for Sub-80 performance. Also to note, a small info window pops up when the polyline is clicked and showing the quality of the linkage along with a hyperlink that takes the user to the Xively site with all the quality reading. Node info window are also setup now that the info window includes the node FeedID which are also configured to have a direct link to the Xively feed record page with all the corresponding information. </p>
<p>Recently we have had the pleasure to welcome Isabel, Xavi’s representative. Detail events will have to check with Mr. Fonoll but it was a chance for the EWRE gangs to get together and so this past Thursday we stopped by Tomuku in Downtown Ann Arbor for a group dinner (pictures? Check <a href = "https://twitter.com/UMhzdc">Twitter</a> : ) With everyone’s birthday coming up I think the next gathering will be in two weeks at <a href = "http://www.mikijapanese.com/">Miki</a> (Japanese restaurant?) for the return and celebration of Caroline’s return (Have fun in N.Y.!!) I guess I’ll have to have things setup so the trip to the <a href = "http://www.lsa.umich.edu/umbs/">Biostation</a> doesn’t bump into our glorious gathering. And with the last minute change in the restaurant choice I think we have the go ahead in setting up the torture plan for Xavi. Please contact me for any idea you would like to suggest. </p>
<p>The picture you see are the radio flyer newly acquired in the lab. We are now capable of hauling the robotic boat as well as sensor stations for deployment as well as presentation. This is a exciting new page to the awesome lab, by the way. The lab location is 1061 GGBL. Stop by and say hi!! </p>

<p>The other two pictures below the awesome radio flyer are the Wednesday event of Peecycler. What happened is that the day’s EWRE seminar we have guest speak from the wonderful <a href = http://richearthinstitute.org/>Rich Earth Institute</a>. and so I think with research requiring human <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine>urine</a>. The department just decided to host an event in the center of everything to collect pee for science. Things to take away from the take is that human urine fertilizer is simply the side product of the bigger goal. The larger picture behind collecting human urine is to separate it from the waste water treatment system. What they found was that almost over half the nutrients including <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus>Phosphorus</a> and <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen>Nitrogen</a> are from human waste. And it takes a huge amount of energy and resource to isolate them when diluted in the waste water system. And so by preventing them from entering the waste water system. We’re potentially saving the energy and resource from being spent in treating them. Also something interesting I learned during the peecycler day adventure. Apparently one will feel like going when the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder">bladder</a> is filled to the 300ml mark (though this varies from person to person.) but the average <a href = "https://youtu.be/7FC7L9W_LQE">flushing capacity</a> at most urinal is 1 gal (3780ml) which in turns are about 10 times dilution. So for the human body equilibrium, what comes in must go out. For the 2 liters of water per average day, about 20L are used towards getting rid of the waste. There’s a lot of water that can be saved here. And so isolating the human waste from the current waste water system we can fertilize the crop, save energy and resource at the waste water treatment facilities, and save water for the same user. Although this may sounds ridiculous to people who are on the east coast, it can be agree that this well be greatly appreciate in the current <a href = "http://ca.gov/drought/">California</a>  situation. <a href = "https://twitter.com/hashtag/peecycler?src=hash">#Peecycler</a>. Save water!!</p>
<p>Another thing that happened this week was Dr.Raskin’s research group meeting. This Friday, Mr. Reddy and James was the presenter. I think it’s a fascinating thing to be working on Arsenic removal in the Bangladesh region. And for your information, the scary orange colored flowing in most of the Arsenic project picture you see around EWRE is the backwash process of the filtration tank. The Ingenuity here is the simplicity of the system. For the filter system we saw, water is pumped up, through the filter and into the storage tank. And so during the backwash period all that’s happening is draining the tank, which in turns reduces the system maintenance cost. </p>
<p>Over the weekend happening in the Ann Arbor region include the Spring game in the big house, and the Ann Arbor Hash Bash event. For Saturday we went to Hash Bash to see all the glory that goes with it. After strolling through the crowd, tired and thirsty, we visited the <a href = "http://www.umma.umich.edu/">Museum of Art</a> as well as the <a href = "https://www.lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/">Kelsey Museum of Archaeology</a> before checking out the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_in_Gold">Women in Gold</a> at <a href = "http://www.michtheater.org/">Michigan Theater</a>. Good weekend!!</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been keeping a book with me at all times, just to get the reading going. Currently I am working on <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">“1984”</a> and I am enjoying the reading as of now. Let me know if you got a book recommendation!!</p>
<p>Lastly, If you got comment or just want to say hi. Feel free to send me an email or just leave a twit <a href = "https://twitter.com/UMhzdc">@umhzdc</a> </p>

<p>Hello my name is Ho-Zhen Chen. This website is hosted by GitHub and the html background was grabbed from the Zurb (http://zurb.com/) </p>
<p>Here at the University of Michigan I worked in the Real-Time Water Systems Lab under the supervision of Prof. Kerkez. Link to the lab website can be found upstairs at the 1061 tab, which is the GGBL room number of the lab.</p></div>

<p>Previously I've been working on sensor housing design. This year, under the supervision of Prof. Kerkez, I'll be setting up a sensor network at the University's Bio-Station. Hardware design at the current moment has been designed for streamline assembly. And I'm working on the data logging and visualization right now. Program currently used include python for data transmission, HTML for the website design, and JavaScript within the HTML for grabbing data and dynamic interaction.</p>
<p>Up where the lab website link is located a "VIZ" tab can be found which will redirect to the visualization page deisgn. Currently we have a small network deployed in a near campus location. While the other two are sitting in the lab (the web location are done to test the Google Map interface.</p>
<p>My contact information can be found below along with my resume for your entertainment. Send me an email and say hi, or even better, send me a postcard!!</p>
<p>Picture from Xavi going to the MSU farm. Thanks Xavi!!</p>
