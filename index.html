<h3><a href="#">Hangout #10</a></h3>
<h6>Written by <a href="#">Ho-Zhen Chen</a> on April 19, 2012.</h6>
<div class="row">
<div class="large-6 columns">
<p>Thank you very much. I can now put <a href = "http://www.mgoblue.com/bighouse5k/map.html">Big House 5K</a> finisher as my experience on my resume. Last Sunday (04/12) I joined <a href = "http://cee.engin.umich.edu/reddy-fellowship">Raghav</a> in running the Big House 5k. The reason we choose the event was because of the $40 registration fee we get a promotion code from <a href = "http://www.rackham.umich.edu/">Rackham Graduate School</a> (which also come with a Rackham T-Shirt.) So the event total was around $20 and comes with 2 T-Shirt. My time was 32 minutes, which I was pretty happy about for my first event (I usually do around 30 – 45 minutes of running in <a href = "http://recsports.umich.edu/facilities/north-campus-recreation-building-ncrb">NCRB</a>, but to join the crowd in doing so, it’s a first.) And the extra time gave Mr. Reddy just enough to find me at the finishing line to record my finish (upload to <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YVn3ty4pg0">YouTube</a>!) So special thanks for Mr. Reddy in inviting me for the run, I’ll definitely get more warm up preparation next time. </p>
<p>Next up I think I did <a href = "http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood">blood donation</a> two days before the run. Which was a fantastic thing. I’ve always be under the concern of minor high blood pressure (this is usually the part where I don’t pass for blood donation.) Let me do some explanation for this. What happen is I am a little overweight for my Asian build. As proven before, as I bring my weigh down to about 160 lb the blood thing just resumes the normal healthy level. Otherwise as is (180lb) at 5’8” it’s a little too much for my body (sodium can also be a factor, but weight is the primary factor.) So with 12 hour notice I was still able to pass the donation test, I was pretty happy about my health performance. I think I did donation on the 9th of April, just 2 days after which I was allowed (last donation I think was in Feb 7th-ish.) So that was good. I tweeted single-hand got plenty of snap chat for the event.</p>
<p>In other exciting news!! I am going to <a href = "http://www.umass.edu/">UMass</a> for Ph.D! But we can discuss the matter later. What’s more exciting is I’m seeing network progress and self-healing going on. What happened is I captured a glimpse of the network downtime around noon today and was planning a physical visit to the network for possible reset. However, right as I was typing up this blog I noticed from the historical data log this had happened overnight for 9 hours and then the node/manager system restored itself backup for the morning then went down for about 2 hours over lunch break today. I think that’s something to note for the system (that it restore itself) and possibly to look out for during field deployment.</p>
<p>On this note. I am currently working on slides for possible presentation. We also have two sensor node plus repeater in the lab ready for tutorial video for the lab prep for future network setup. Hopefully things come in over the weekend/earlier next week to for the tutorial video before graduation. Stay tuned for future work to be upload!! </p>

<p>During the course of being at Michigan. My perspective on things like subject matter changed as I get exposed to more things like <a href = "http://envbiotech.engin.umich.edu/raskin/people/">other research group meetings</a> and seminar and field trip to research sites. And so picking up where I had left off. While I was waiting for a quick meeting with Professor Raskin, I caught up with the Professor I had Environmental Microbiology with and ask for the same syllabus we had in the year of 2013 and hopefully I can go over the book again at my own pace, with help from friends (who Aced the class and as future GSI) on the subject matter. Graduating as a Wolverine Environmental Engineer, while I am venturing beyond the masters at Michigan, Michigan can be proud of having me as a wolverine. The next subject of which I’ll be doing this will be environmental processes. Another course that I am not familiar with but a core subject in the field. What is interesting is that as I joined the Environmental Biotechnology Group meeting of EWRE. Course theory seem closer than they were compare to how they’re presented in class. <a href = "Hydraulic retention time">HRT</a> and reactor size an all the micro bacterial community are now given meaning than just ink on the textbook. I think this time around I’ll be having much more fun approaching the subject and am exciting to be reviewing it now than never!! </p>
<p>Same thing applies to the statistics I was working on. Time to get serious again, haha! What happened was I was reviewing my undergrad statistic <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistics-Engineering-Sciences-Devore/dp/0538733527">“Probability and Statistics for Engineering and sciences” by Jay L. Devore</a>. I’ve been working on it for about a month and a half going through 10 pages per day but as things got piled up, the project was put on hold, until now. I am on page 300 now. Let’s plan to finish it by the end of the summer.</p>
<p>One thing I appreciated so very much of is the amateur membership to be <a href = "http://envbiotech.engin.umich.edu/">Environmental BioTechnology group</a>. This whole thing started when I recognized that all my EWRE friends (future colleagues) are in the Environmental BioTechnology group. Since I thought it may be a good idea to know what they’re doing (if I don’t have the solution, at least I know who to contact.) and so with permission from <a href = "http://cee.engin.umich.edu/Lutgarde_Raskin">Professor. Raskin</a> I was able to join the research group meeting and see how everything I’ve learned so far are put into used (at the cutting edge of the field.) and I am please sometimes during the meeting they’ll have some short review of what the term/process is in a way that I can understand it. Things we’ve covered include <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-defrost">temperature fluctuating refrigerator</a> and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_type">wild type genes</a> plus <a href = "http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout">gene knock out</a>. Although I’m not sure if it’s going to happen just with the idea I am truly honored to simply the idea of being included in the Michigan Environmental Biotechnology group. Special thanks to Dr. Raskin, the wild type Pandas, and everyone in the group that helped out along the way!! Really appreciate having me on the team, you will all be missed (and if I don’t have your address, please check your EWRE mailbox on a monthly basis!!) </p>
<p>On to other things. As graduation approach, we can never forget that around half of us in the EWRE program will be leaving Michigan (the school if not the state.) One immediate effect to the department’s gender ratio. Interesting enough, on one of the occasion that I actually read the ASEE magazine – Prism, it actually have a statistic of the gender radio of most of the engineering discipline, and Environmental Engineering came second to Engineering Management as a second highest the male-female ratio in all of the engineering field of study. This year, with us leaving. And with mostly female incoming Ph.D. The gender ratio is going to be one interesting thing represented at most volunteering event regarding engineering and future scientific projects.</p>
<p>As to future plans. The famous <a href = "http://envbiotech.engin.umich.edu/raskin/people/xavier-fonoll/">Xavi Fonoll</a> will be returning to <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and then to <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a> for his thesis, so those who plan to visit Mexico please be reminded of the fact and take that fact to heart before ordering your airline ticket. Our <a href = "http://envbiotech.engin.umich.edu/raskin/people/pedro-puente/">social chair</a> (of the <a href = "http://www.icc.coop/prospective/houses/northcampus.php">Escher Co-Operative House</a>) will be touring Europe for the summer before returning to <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador">Ecuador</a> for work. Mr. Reddy should be around Michigan for a little longer when the weather’s good with work related to the University and I’ll be around for the summer before moving to Massachusetts for my Ph.D in the <a href = "http://cee.umass.edu/environmental-water-resources-engineering">Environmental & Water Resources Engineering</a> at UMass. </p>
<p>Next time! The tutorial video should be coming up soon. Along with graduation events.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="large-6 columns">
<p>Latest update on the ongoing website design. The <a href = "Panda.html">VIZ</a> page has been updated with Google map with polylines connecting manager, repeater, and sensor node. Polyline <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colorpicker.asp">color code</a> are setup according to Michigan’s Parking lot ranking. Except for light green (#00FF00) representing 90+ quality performance, Blue (#0000CC), Yellow (#FFFF00'), Orange (#FF3300), and then Red (#FF0000) for Sub-80 performance. Also to note, a small info window pops up when the polyline is clicked and showing the quality of the linkage along with a hyperlink that takes the user to the Xively site with all the quality reading. Node info window are also setup now that the info window includes the node FeedID which are also configured to have a direct link to the Xively feed record page with all the corresponding information. </p>
<p>Recently we have had the pleasure to welcome Isabel, Xavi’s representative. Detail events will have to check with Mr. Fonoll but it was a chance for the EWRE gangs to get together and so this past Thursday we stopped by Tomuku in Downtown Ann Arbor for a group dinner (pictures? Check <a href = "https://twitter.com/UMhzdc">Twitter</a> : ) With everyone’s birthday coming up I think the next gathering will be in two weeks at <a href = "http://www.mikijapanese.com/">Miki</a> (Japanese restaurant?) for the return and celebration of Caroline’s return (Have fun in N.Y.!!) I guess I’ll have to have things setup so the trip to the <a href = "http://www.lsa.umich.edu/umbs/">Biostation</a> doesn’t bump into our glorious gathering. And with the last minute change in the restaurant choice I think we have the go ahead in setting up the torture plan for Xavi. Please contact me for any idea you would like to suggest. </p>
<p>The picture you see are the radio flyer newly acquired in the lab. We are now capable of hauling the robotic boat as well as sensor stations for deployment as well as presentation. This is a exciting new page to the awesome lab, by the way. The lab location is 1061 GGBL. Stop by and say hi!! </p>

<p>The other two pictures below the awesome radio flyer are the Wednesday event of Peecycler. What happened is that the day’s EWRE seminar we have guest speak from the wonderful <a href = http://richearthinstitute.org/>Rich Earth Institute</a>. and so I think with research requiring human <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine>urine</a>. The department just decided to host an event in the center of everything to collect pee for science. Things to take away from the take is that human urine fertilizer is simply the side product of the bigger goal. The larger picture behind collecting human urine is to separate it from the waste water treatment system. What they found was that almost over half the nutrients including <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus>Phosphorus</a> and <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen>Nitrogen</a> are from human waste. And it takes a huge amount of energy and resource to isolate them when diluted in the waste water system. And so by preventing them from entering the waste water system. We’re potentially saving the energy and resource from being spent in treating them. Also something interesting I learned during the peecycler day adventure. Apparently one will feel like going when the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder">bladder</a> is filled to the 300ml mark (though this varies from person to person.) but the average <a href = "https://youtu.be/7FC7L9W_LQE">flushing capacity</a> at most urinal is 1 gal (3780ml) which in turns are about 10 times dilution. So for the human body equilibrium, what comes in must go out. For the 2 liters of water per average day, about 20L are used towards getting rid of the waste. There’s a lot of water that can be saved here. And so isolating the human waste from the current waste water system we can fertilize the crop, save energy and resource at the waste water treatment facilities, and save water for the same user. Although this may sounds ridiculous to people who are on the east coast, it can be agree that this well be greatly appreciate in the current <a href = "http://ca.gov/drought/">California</a>  situation. <a href = "https://twitter.com/hashtag/peecycler?src=hash">#Peecycler</a>. Save water!!</p>
<p>Another thing that happened this week was Dr.Raskin’s research group meeting. This Friday, Mr. Reddy and James was the presenter. I think it’s a fascinating thing to be working on Arsenic removal in the Bangladesh region. And for your information, the scary orange colored flowing in most of the Arsenic project picture you see around EWRE is the backwash process of the filtration tank. The Ingenuity here is the simplicity of the system. For the filter system we saw, water is pumped up, through the filter and into the storage tank. And so during the backwash period all that’s happening is draining the tank, which in turns reduces the system maintenance cost. </p>
<p>Over the weekend happening in the Ann Arbor region include the Spring game in the big house, and the Ann Arbor Hash Bash event. For Saturday we went to Hash Bash to see all the glory that goes with it. After strolling through the crowd, tired and thirsty, we visited the <a href = "http://www.umma.umich.edu/">Museum of Art</a> as well as the <a href = "https://www.lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/">Kelsey Museum of Archaeology</a> before checking out the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_in_Gold">Women in Gold</a> at <a href = "http://www.michtheater.org/">Michigan Theater</a>. Good weekend!!</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been keeping a book with me at all times, just to get the reading going. Currently I am working on <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">“1984”</a> and I am enjoying the reading as of now. Let me know if you got a book recommendation!!</p>
<p>Lastly, If you got comment or just want to say hi. Feel free to send me an email or just leave a twit <a href = "https://twitter.com/UMhzdc">@umhzdc</a> </p>

<p>Previously I've been working on sensor housing design. This year, under the supervision of Prof. Kerkez, I'll be setting up a sensor network at the University's Bio-Station. Hardware design at the current moment has been designed for streamline assembly. And I'm working on the data logging and visualization right now. Program currently used include python for data transmission, HTML for the website design, and JavaScript within the HTML for grabbing data and dynamic interaction.</p>
<p>Up where the lab website link is located a "VIZ" tab can be found which will redirect to the visualization page deisgn. Currently we have a small network deployed in a near campus location. While the other two are sitting in the lab (the web location are done to test the Google Map interface.</p>
<p>My contact information can be found below along with my resume for your entertainment. Send me an email and say hi, or even better, send me a postcard!!</p>
<p>Picture from Xavi going to the MSU farm. Thanks Xavi!!</p>
