<h2>Jul-25-2017 Weighted Least <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Square">Square</a> (WLS)</h2>
<p>
Here's a picture of my study progress? Their topics happen to line up on the same day.. Coincidence?
<br>
<br>
<img src = "pictureHere/2017_07_25_WLS.jpg" height="600" width="800" align="middle" /> 
<br>
<br>
Building up to today's reading. Things were kind of lining up so one can kind of have an idea of what tomorrow is going to bring. But I just didn't expect the two to line up on the same day. 
<br>
<br>
Weighted Least Square (WLS) in short, can be thought of as imaginary gird scale change (squares, from my understanding.) Error for a regression line is calculated as the measured distance between actual data points from the predicted data points (the regression line.) For some cases, however, not all measurements are created equal. As a result, errors are assigned different weights before they are summed for the entire line, thus the name weighted least square (WLS).

Another picture of happiness is the <a href="http://www.hitachi.us/">Hitachi</a> <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/topics/steamer"> steamer</a>. It can be used to cook rice and all the other stuff. The steamer is tested and good for rice. The inside sticker also mentioned for safety (and convenience) cook using a removable container (so the cleaning is easier.) Very happy with the new toy and the cumulative time it will save moving forward. 
<br>
<br>
Another thought before we go. Since I am no longer affiliated with UMass. Time for new <a href="http://www.vistaprint.com">cards</a>? What about just a line with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URL</a> to this site? 
<br>

To all the pandas out there,

<h2>Jul-21-2017 Self-Search and content creation.</h2>
<p>
As I enter the job search progress, it occur that this will be a good time to restart this section as I move forward in tallying what I have accomplished and perhaps do some reflection on life.
<br>
<br>
Here a list of what a normal day look like recently.
<br>
<br>
1.) Job search <br>
2.) reading <a href="http://www.laylinalgebra.com/">Linear Algebra</a> (David C. Lay) <br>
3.) reading <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/robert-hirsch">Statistical Methods in Water Resources</a> (Robert Hirsch)<br>
4.) read another paper<br>
<br>
The first three came along this summer and the last one is the new resolution this year. The motivation for it shall be discuss later. I love this paper thing and it is awesome!
<br>
<br>
One question that I was forced to reflect upon this summer was the initial intention on pursuing a graduate degree, and this has always been to teach STEM at the college level. From a <a href="https://aeesp2017.com/">recent conference</a> learning and some discussion with specialist in this field, it seem that education, not engineering, will be the key to getting me there. So the reading has change from climate change to engineering education (more on that later.) 
<br>
<br>
Since both our attention span has reached its limit, here's a picture for distraction. Picutre is of <a href="http://www.amherstcoffee.com/">Amherst Coffee</a>
 taken from the <a href="https://www.joneslibrary.org/">Jones Library</a> on a summer afternoon. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
And congratulations on a former colleague's accomplishment. Congratulations on <a href="https://twitter.com/CynCastro88">Cynthia Castro</a>'s doctoral defense. 
<br>
<br>
Until next time.

<h2>Feb-19-2017 First post. AGU 2017 Fall Meeting</h2>

<p>
Just finished today's assign reading and wanted to update GitHub website thing. 
Here's a picture of Colin and I with my poster at the 2017 American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall meeting. 
<br>
<br>
<img src = "pictureHere/2017_AGU_CG_HZ.jpg" height="600" width="800" align="middle" /> 
<br>
<br>
I had a good time at AGU seeing all the mythical authors previously exists only in <a href="http://apps.webofknowledge.com/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&SID=1FCJuyxOSn2PcF3qxBl&preferencesSaved=">Web of Science</a> in person, as well as meeting the family. I think it was just a good feeling knowing how our work fits into the larger picture. Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission, different groups that are also study the cryosphere in different ways, and other hydrology work going on elsewhere. It is good knowing we're not alone :)
