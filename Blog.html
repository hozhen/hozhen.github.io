<h2>Feb-19-2017 First post. AGU 2017 Fall Meeting</h2>

<p>
Just finished today's assign reading and wanted to update GitHub website thing. 
Here's a picture of Colin and I with my poster at the 2017 American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall meeting.

I had a good time at AGU seeing all the mythical authors previously exists only in <a href="http://apps.webofknowledge.com/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&SID=1FCJuyxOSn2PcF3qxBl&preferencesSaved=">Web of Science</a> in person, as well as meeting the family. I think it was just a good feeling knowing how our work fits into the larger picture. Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission, different groups that are also study the cryosphere in different ways, and other hydrology work going on elsewhere. It is good knowing we're not alone :)
